<h3>TITLE</h3>
  <p>Cosmotonic</p>
<h3>SHORT PITCH</h3>
  <p>Cosmotonic gives you the unique chance to see what astronauts do; whether that is educating you on space, showing you how they train, or launching you into space. </p>
<h3>LONG PITCH</h3>
  <p>Our business is for outer space enthusiasts at any age. Children, adults, and elderly are able to learn about comets, planets, and stars in our family-friendly education center. They can also experience astronauts in training first hand to see what practice tests they do and so what. For a price, you can actually get launched into space! This is the only thing we offer that has an age range, which is 21-60 yo, for obvious reasons.</p>
